# Project Overview Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This skill guides an agent to inspect an existing repository and produce a complete `project_overview.md` knowledge base.

The document must help future agents understand the project before making changes. It should answer:

- What is this project?
- How is it structured?
- What architecture style does it use?
- Which technologies, frameworks, tools, and runtime dependencies does it use?
- What are the main domains and business concepts?
- What features exist and where are they implemented?
- What services, modules, background workers, jobs, consumers, and producers exist?
- How do services/modules communicate?
- What APIs, events, contracts, database tables, and external integrations exist?
- What coding conventions and design styles should future agents follow?
- How is the project configured, tested, deployed, observed, and secured?
- What risks, unknowns, or follow-up questions should be tracked?

The final output must be a markdown file named:

```text
project_overview.md
```

This file is intended to be a durable knowledge base for future agents.

---

## Core Principle

Document only what is supported by repository evidence.

Do not invent architecture, services, patterns, technologies, business rules, commands, database tables, APIs, or deployment details.

When the evidence is incomplete, mark the claim explicitly:

```text
Status: confirmed
Status: inferred
Status: unclear
Status: needs confirmation
```

Use confidence labels when describing inferred architecture or conventions:

```text
Confidence: high
Confidence: medium
Confidence: low
```

Prefer evidence from:

- Source code
- README files
- Existing docs
- Project files
- Package manifests
- Lock files
- Build scripts
- Docker files
- CI/CD files
- Infrastructure files
- API definitions
- Database migrations
- Message/event contracts
- Tests
- Configuration files
- Environment examples
- Deployment scripts

If documentation and code disagree, call that out:

```markdown
The documentation says X, but the code appears to do Y.
Status: needs confirmation.
```

---

## When To Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- Project overview
- Architecture overview
- Technical documentation
- Onboarding documentation
- Codebase analysis
- Project knowledge base
- `project_overview.md`
- System analysis
- Service map
- Domain map
- Feature map
- API/event/database overview
- Documentation for future AI agents

Example triggers:

```text
Overview toàn bộ project này giúp tôi.
Tạo project_overview.md cho repo này.
Phân tích kiến trúc project.
Document toàn bộ services/domain/features.
Tạo knowledge base để agent sau sử dụng.
Map toàn bộ API, service, domain, database, event.
```

---

## Output Contract

The required deliverable is:

```text
project_overview.md
```

The agent must either:

1. Create or update `project_overview.md` directly when file-write access is available.
2. Otherwise, output the full markdown content so the user can save it manually.

Do not only summarize in chat. The deliverable must be the actual markdown content or file.

After creating or updating the file, respond with a concise summary:

```markdown
Created `project_overview.md`.

Summary:
- Architecture: ...
- Main technologies: ...
- Main domains: ...
- Main services/modules: ...
- Key risks/unknowns: ...

Recommended next step:
- Review sections marked `needs confirmation`.
```

---

## Required Workflow

### Phase 1: Repository Discovery

Inspect the repository before writing the overview.

Start broad. Identify top-level structure and key metadata files.

Look for:

```text
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
docs/
.ai/
.github/
.gitlab/
.vscode/
.editorconfig
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn.lock
package-lock.json
*.csproj
*.sln
Directory.Build.props
Directory.Packages.props
global.json
NuGet.config
pom.xml
build.gradle
go.mod
Cargo.toml
pyproject.toml
requirements.txt
composer.json
Gemfile
appsettings*.json
application*.yml
application*.properties
.env.example
Dockerfile
docker-compose*.yml
helm/
k8s/
kubernetes/
terraform/
Makefile
Taskfile.yml
src/
app/
lib/
test/
tests/
spec/
integration-tests/
e2e/
migrations/
database/
schema/
proto/
openapi/
swagger/
```

Identify:

- Project type
- Runtime
- Main programming language
- Frameworks
- Application entry points
- Build system
- Test system
- Deployment system
- Main directories
- Existing documentation

Do not produce the final document until the repository shape is understood.

For large repositories, use breadth-first discovery:

1. Read top-level files.
2. Map major directories.
3. Identify entry points.
4. Inspect representative files per module/domain.
5. Inspect config, contracts, database, messaging, and tests.
6. Produce the first overview.

Do not try to read every file before creating the first useful version.

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Detection

Determine the architecture style from evidence.

Look for signs of:

- Monolith
- Modular monolith
- Microservices
- Layered architecture
- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture / Ports and Adapters
- Vertical Slice Architecture
- CQRS
- Event-driven architecture
- Message-driven architecture
- Worker/consumer architecture
- API gateway
- Background jobs
- Plugin architecture
- Shared kernel
- Domain-driven design
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Store/branch-based architecture
- Cloud-native architecture
- Frontend/backend split
- BFF pattern
- Data pipeline architecture

For each detected style, include:

- What was detected
- Evidence
- Where it appears in code
- Confidence
- Caveats or uncertainty

Example:

```markdown
### Architecture Style

This project appears to follow a modular monolith style.

Evidence:
- Multiple business modules are located under `src/Modules`.
- Shared infrastructure is located under `src/Shared`.
- Modules appear to communicate through application services and integration events.

Confidence: medium
Status: inferred
```

---

### Phase 3: Technology Stack Discovery

Identify and document the technology stack.

Include:

- Programming languages

- API technologies
- Frontend stack, if any
- Testing frameworks
- Build tools
- Deployment tools
- Infrastructure tools

Prefer exact versions when available.

Output format:

```markdown
## 4. Technology Stack

| Area | Technology | Version | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backend | .NET | 8.0 | `global.json`, `*.csproj` | confirmed |
| Database | SQL Server | not found | connection strings in `appsettings.json` | inferred |
| Messaging | Kafka | not found | MassTransit Kafka references | inferred |
```

If a version cannot be found, write:

```text
Version: not found
```

---

### Phase 4: Repository and Project Structure Mapping

Map the main folders and explain their roles.

Do not describe every file. Focus on meaningful folders and architectural boundaries.

Output format:

```markdown
## 5. Project Structure

```text
src/
  Api/
  Application/
  Domain/
  Infrastructure/
tests/
docs/
```

| Path | Responsibility | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/Api` | Hosts HTTP endpoints and application startup | Contains `Program.cs` | confirmed |
| `src/Domain` | Contains domain entities and business rules | Naming suggests domain layer | inferred |
```

Mention unclear folders separately.

---

### Phase 5: Domain Discovery

Identify business domains from:

```

### Asynchronous Communication

```text
Producer -> Message Broker -> Consumer -> Database / External Service
```

### Event Flow

```text
OrderCreated
  -> InventoryConsumer

| OrderCreated | Event | `order-created` | Notifies order creation | `InventoryConsumer` | inferred |
```

If routes/contracts are inferred from code rather than generated docs, mark them as inferred.

---

### Phase 11: Functional Flow Documentation

Document important end-to-end flows.

Each flow should include:

- Trigger

- Update this file when architecture, major features, services, integrations, or contracts change.
```

---

## Required `project_overview.md` Structure

The final file must use this exact top-level structure:

```markdown
# Project Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

## 2. Repository Map

## 3. Architecture Overview

## 4. Technology Stack

## 5. Project Structure

## 6. Domain Overview

## 7. Feature Overview

## 8. Services and Modules

## 9. Communication Between Services

## 10. Data Architecture

## 11. API and Contracts

## 12. Functional Flows

## 13. Configuration and Runtime

## 14. Coding Conventions

## 15. Testing Overview

## 16. Operational Concerns

## 17. Security Overview

## 18. Risks and Unknowns

## 19. Recommendations for Future Agents

## 20. Evidence Index
```

---

## Evidence Index Requirement

The final section must list important files inspected.

Example:

```markdown
## 20. Evidence Index

| File / Path | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Project introduction and setup |
| `src/Api/Program.cs` | Application startup and dependency injection |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local infrastructure |
| `tests/` | Test strategy and covered behavior |
```

This is mandatory. It helps future agents know where the overview came from.

---

## Update Rules

If `project_overview.md` already exists:

1. Read the existing file first.
2. Preserve useful existing knowledge.
3. Update outdated sections.
4. Add newly discovered evidence.
5. Mark changed assumptions.
6. Do not delete uncertain sections unless they are confirmed obsolete.
7. Keep the required top-level structure.

---

## Documentation Rules

### Be factual

Do not write:

```markdown
The project uses Kafka.
```

unless Kafka is actually found in code/config/docs.

Prefer:

```markdown
Kafka appears to be used based on `MassTransit.Kafka` references in project files.
Status: inferred
```

### Mark uncertainty

Use explicit status labels:

```text
Status: confirmed
Status: inferred
Status: unclear
Status: needs confirmation
```

### Use confidence for inferred architecture

```text
Confidence: high
Confidence: medium
Confidence: low
```

### Prefer tables for inventory

Use tables for:

- Technology stack
- Repository map
- Services/modules
- Domains
- Features
- APIs
- Events
- Data stores
- Configuration files
- Tests
- Operational concerns
- Security mechanisms
- Risks

### Prefer numbered steps for flows

Use numbered lists for functional flows.

### Avoid large raw code blocks

Do not paste large source code blocks.

Summarize behavior and reference file paths instead.

### Avoid over-documenting trivial files

Focus on knowledge useful for future agents.
